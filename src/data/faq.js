Additionally, we want to explore how to empower communities, reduce bureaucracy, promote skill sharing and encourage learning; from project proposal to real-world prototype.<br /><br />Whether it is a new tool or an innovative application: it is clear to us that all public interest innovations must remain adaptable and accessible to ensure they benefit society. That is why we only accept open source project proposals.`
