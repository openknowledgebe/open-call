  <p class="intro-text">
    The high level of civic engagement in the current COVID-19 crisis and the
    open source revolution initiated by the Prototype Fund in Germany inspired

    to take its community-driven approach to the next level. That is why, we aim
    to
    <strong>
      develop 4 public interest tech projects with the power of the community at
      Open Summer of Code 2020!
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    You’re strongly encouraged to
    <a href="https://osoc.typeform.com/to/tGnsYT" target="blank">
      submit your open source project proposal
    </a>
    that fits with one of the topics before Friday 8 May 2020. If your proposal
    gets selected by the jury, you’ll get the opportunity to
    <strong>
      co-create a prototype with a team of students and government experts
    </strong>
    at Open Summer of Code, which will take place from Monday 6 until Thursday
    30 July 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
    By submitting your project idea, you do not only share your idea(s) but also
    your intention to be involved in the tenth edition of Open Summer of Code in
    July.
  </p>
  <p>
    Why do we do this? Whether it is a new tool or an innovative application: it
    is clear to us that
    <strong>
      all public interest innovations must remain adaptable and accessible
    </strong>
    to ensure they benefit society. That is why we
    <strong>only accept open source project proposals</strong>
    .
  </p>
  <p>
    We aim to bring civil society, open source developers and government experts
    into closer contact. Additionally, we want to explore how to empower
    communities, reduce bureaucracy, promote skill sharing and encourage
    learning from project proposal to real-world prototype.
